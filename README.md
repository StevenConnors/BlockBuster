# BlockBuster

BlockBuster is a game created for Carnegie Mellon Universtiy HCII's 05-833, Applied Gadgets, Sensors, and Activity Recognition in HCI course. 

The objective of this project was to make an interactive game using an Arduino Nano and a 8 by 8 single color LED Matrix. 

For this project I made the game BlockBuster. The user location can be controlled by a potentiometer.
